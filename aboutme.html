          <h2>About me, <span class="text-muted">Hunter Holmes!</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Hi. I'm Hunter Holmes. I've been teaching guitar in the Newton/Wellesley area for over 20 years. I'm also a Berklee graduate. If your looking for a teacher to come to your home please read on. My lessons are unique. If there's one thing I'm not, it's a" professional page turner." As for references: I've been at this for so long, if you were to ask me about other people in your neighborhood, I'd most likely be able to name a neighbor or school friend that you or someone in you family knows. I love what I do, and I do it well. I see people from ages 7 right up to age 72. I have many musical credits: Here's one quick one. I performed for the President of the United States, Bill Clinton at his inauguration January of 1993. What's more important to you is that I know how to teach and work with people (all ages). Leave it to me, I'll bring out your best. <a href="/contact.html">Please give me a call</a>! </p>
