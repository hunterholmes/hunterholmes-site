        <h2><a name="testimonials"></a>Testimonial</h2>
        <h3>Kathleen &ndash; Drums</h3>
        <p>Hunter Holmes is a treasure!  He has been my drum teacher for the past 12 years, 12 years of lessons which are always a pure joy.  He not only comes to your home&mdash;a definite plus&mdash;but he comes with his electric guitar and amp, and plays and sings while you play the drums, beginning with your very first lesson.  You instantly feel as though you're in a rock band, and a great one at that, since he has years of experience as a performer, as well as a teacher.  It is far easier to relax and get into the music, as he sings and plays guitar along with you, instead of focusing on your sticks and whether or not you're doing a good job.  It's PLAYING MUSIC, being a drummer&mdash;exactly what you're after. </p>
        <p>Hunter knows music, rhythm, harmony&mdash;having graduated from Berklee&mdash;but also seems to know every rock song, and the bands and drummers for each song.  He's an amazing drummer himself, teaches rudiments, is helpful in suggesting drum fills, rhythms, and practice techniques.  </p>
        <p>Lessons are always so energizing and such fun, even when my work & travel schedules have limited my practice time.  Along the way I've learned so much, not only about drumming but about the history of rock, and have been introduced to so many bands, songs, and styles.  Most importantly he's stimulated my own interest in reading and learning more, and enhanced my ability to listen, to hear the drums, how musical they are, how they add to the music... beyond just keeping the beat.</p>
        <p>As a person who'd never been comfortable performing, a true highlight of my life was  last year when I actually performed with Hunter at a party my husband and I had for 100 of our long-time friends to celebrate out 70th birthdays.  We rocked for 45 minutes, and people loved it&mdash;they even danced&mdash;it was just so exhilarating&mdash;an unbelievable experience! And it makes me want to do it again, and again!</p>
