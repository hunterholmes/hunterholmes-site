            <p class="lead"><strong>Imagine</strong> playing the drums and feeling like you're already in a band, only it's your very first lesson. Here's your chance to make your dream a reality. It's time to really enjoy yourself.</p>
            <p class="lead">Quite simply, with my approach, I'm your guitarist. That's right! I come to your place with an electric guitar and a (small but loud enough) amp. I teach you how to play and back you up with my strong rhythm. This approach works! In fact it works far better than I ever imagined, and it's ten times as fun. From day one my students are learning what it <strong>feels like to jam with another person!</strong> As they progress they become far more musical and much less mechanical. These are just a few of the advantages to my unique approach. Yes, I teach rudiments. Yes I can teach you to read drum music. Personally, <em>I don't think too many people decided to take up drums just so they could learn how to read drum music</em>. People just want to play, the same way some people just want to dance.</p>
            <p class="lead">Drumming with a live electric guitar is a little like, well let me put it this way, like putting you in the drivers seat of a very fancy sports car and going for a very nice ride!</p>
            <p class="lead">Young or old, 7 or 70... Drums always sound better with a musical instrument. It's true! See for yourself. <a href="/contact.html">Call me today</a>.</p>
